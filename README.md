1. Problem Statement:
- Train a model to extract legal entities from legal documents.

2. Analysis and Extraction:
- EDA and extraction code present in src/code.ipynb

- Structured Information Extraction: NER is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing named entities (such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) into predefined classes. Legal documents often contain structured information about entities, making NER a suitable technique for extracting this structured data.
spaCy is a popular and widely used natural language processing (NLP) library because of its numerous advantages and features that make it suitable for entity extraction, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), in legal documents.

Combining this with CL techniques we can extract the required information from the legal documents.
